# Bloomon Challenge

## Task

* You are required to build **both** the **client** & **API**
* The frontend UI should be built in **React**
* The API in **Node.js / Express** with **MySQL**
* You can **add more libs / frameworks if you want to** but please **explain** below why you chose them.

Spend **a maximum of 8 hours** on this assignment, the goal is to create an **MVP** where you **show off your technical abilities and workflow.**

**WE DO NOT EXPECT YOU TO COMPLETE EVERYTHING**
 
## The Challenge Itself

The idea is to build a slimmed down bouquet subscription page. 

The application must contain a minimum of **2 pages**:

### Details Page

The user should see an **overview** of **8 weeks** here.

- **1 week before** the current week
- the **current week**
- **6 weeks after** the current week

see [calendar_detail.png](calendar_detail.png) for a possible solution, you're free to provide your own solution

in this example:

- **black dot**: current day
- **gray dot**: delivery moment

A user must be able to set **a minimum** of following parameters:

All changes to these parameters should be directly reflected in the calendar. When everything is filled in the User should be able to submit this to the Database and be redirected to the 'Summary' page.

### Firstname

The user's first name

### Country

Fetched from the API

### Delivery Moments

Fetched from the API (specific per country)

Possible delivery moments per country (provided in the database) are:

- **Germany**: Tuesday / Thursday
- **Netherlands**: Wednesday / Friday
- **United Kingdom**: Thursday / Friday

### Delivery Frequencies

(hardcoded values)

Possible delivery frequencies are:

- every **2** weeks
- every **4** weeks

## Summary Page

The 'Summary' page should contain the following text, make sure the placeholders are filled in correctly.

---

Thanks for creating a Bloomon subscription **[firstname]**, your first bouquet will be delivered on **[first delivery date]** 

Just **[nights of sleep]** nights of sleep left...

After that you will receive our beautiful bouquets every **[frequency]** weeks on **[weekday]**.

* Modern JS techniques.
* Best practices.
